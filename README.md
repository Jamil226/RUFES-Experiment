# RUFES: Reinforcement Learning-Based Unified Fusion of Execution, Semantic, and Structural Evidence for Automated Software Fault Localization


Automated fault localization is a critical software engineering challenge designed to reduce manual debugging effort and accelerate bug-fixing workflows. Traditional Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) methods rely solely on code coverage and fail to capture semantic meaning or structural dependencies. 

**RUFES** addresses these limitations by adaptively fusing execution, structural, and semantic evidence using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. By modeling fault localization as a ranking-oriented decision-making problem, the PPO reinforcement learning agent learns to dynamically assign optimal weights to diverse evidence sources based on codebase characteristics.

## 🚀 Key Features and Experimental Outcomes

*   **Adaptive PPO Fusion Agent:** Uses a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to map a 9D contextual codebase state vector into optimal 3D simplex fusion weights ($\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 = 1.0$).
*   **State-of-the-Art Localization Accuracy:** Verified evaluations on the Defects4J benchmark show RUFES achieves:
    *   **Top-1 Accuracy:** **0.80** (presents the fault in the first rank for 80% of the bugs)
    *   **Top-3 / Top-5 / Top-10 Accuracy:** **1.00**
    *   **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):** **0.8917**
    *   **Mean Average Precision (MAP):** **0.8917**
    *   **EXAM Score:** **0.0230** (developers inspect only **2.30%** of the codebase to locate the fault)
*   **Multi-Granular Dependency Extraction:** Automatically parses Java ASTs to extract File, Method, and Statement-level nodes and control-flow, data-flow (def-use chains), call, and inheritance edges.
*   **Contextual Semantic Embeddings:** Encodes tokenized source code and bug descriptions into a shared 384-dimensional vector space using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` SentenceTransformer to compute cosine similarities.
*   **Robust Generalizability:** Generalizes well to unseen projects in cross-project settings, maintaining a strong MRR of **0.7431** and an EXAM score of **0.0384**.

## 📊 Scientific Framework and Formulations

The mathematical framework powering RUFES is fully aligned with implementation code:

1. **Ochiai suspiciousness ($S_{exec}$):**
   $$S_{exec}(v_i) = \frac{n_{ef}(v_i)}{\sqrt{|\mathcal{T}_f| \cdot (n_{ef}(v_i)+n_{ep}(v_i))}}$$
2. **Structural Graph Propagation ($S_{struct}$):**
   $$S_{struct}(v_i) = (1-\alpha)S_{exec}(v_i) + \alpha \sum_{v_j \in N(v_i)} w_{ij}S_{exec}(v_j)$$
   *Subject to normalizations $\sum_{v_j \in N(v_i)} w_{ij} = 1.0$, with optimal propagation alpha $\alpha = 0.60$.*
3. **Semantic Relevance similarity ($S_{sem}$):**
   $$S_{sem}(v_i) = \frac{\mathbf{z}_i^T\mathbf{z}_B}{\|\mathbf{z}_i\|_2\|\mathbf{z}_B\|_2}$$
4. **Simplex Fusion Score ($S_{fusion}$):**
   $$S_{fusion}(v_i) = \lambda_1\hat{S}_{exec}(v_i) + \lambda_2\hat{S}_{struct}(v_i) + \lambda_3\hat{S}_{sem}(v_i)$$
   *Subject to simplex constraints $\sum \lambda_j = 1.0$ dynamically computed by the PPO actor policy.*
